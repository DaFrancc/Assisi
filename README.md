# Assisi Engine

Assisi is a modern C++ game engine focused on building clean, modular systems for
real-time games. This project is primarily for my own education and for my own
needs first. Suggestions, PRs, forks, and bug reports are welcome. Use of this
codebase or engine in your own projects or forks is 100% welcome and free of charge if in compliance
with the license, and I kindly ask that you credit the engine and myself 
(Francisco Vivas Puerto aka DaFrancc) in both the repo (if public) and any games you make with this engine.
Currently I am not accepting donations since I do not feel that the project is currently in a state
worthy of accepting donations.
